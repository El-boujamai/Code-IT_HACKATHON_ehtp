# Understanding the CodeVision VR Platform

Based on the project description and structure you've shared, let me explain how the CodeVision VR platform should work and what you need to set up.

## Overall Architecture

CodeVision VR consists of three main components:

1. **Web Frontend** (React): Where users write code and access lessons
2. **Backend Server** (Node.js): Handles code analysis, user data, and communication
3. **Unity VR Application**: Provides the immersive visualization of code

## How the Platform Works

Here's the typical flow of how the platform would work:

1. **User writes code** in the web interface (React frontend)
2. **Code is sent to the backend** for parsing and analysis
3. **Backend transforms the code** into a structured representation (using AST)
4. **Backend sends visualization data** to the Unity VR application via WebSockets
5. **Unity renders the 3D visualization** of the code structure/execution
6. **User can interact with the visualization** in VR to understand concepts

## What You Need to Set Up

### 1. Set Up the Frontend (React)

```bash
mkdir -p codevision-vr/frontend
cd codevision-vr/frontend
npm create vite@latest . --template react
npm install monaco-editor @monaco-editor/react socket.io-client axios
```

Create key components:
- Code editor using Monaco
- Lesson content viewer
- Controls to navigate between web and VR views

### 2. Set Up the Backend (Node.js)

```bash
mkdir -p codevision-vr/backend
cd codevision-vr/backend
npm init -y
npm install express socket.io cors acorn esprima body-parser
```

Implement:
- WebSocket server for real-time communication
- Code parsing using AST libraries like Acorn or Esprima
- Endpoints for saving/loading user code and progress

### 3. Set Up the Unity VR Project

1. Create a new Unity project targeting VR platforms
2. Import necessary packages:
   - XR Interaction Toolkit
   - NativeWebSocket (for WebSocket communication)

3. Create core systems:
   - WebSocket client (similar to the code you shared)
   - Visualization generator for code structures
   - Interactive 3D representations of data structures and algorithms

### 4. Connect the Components

The WebSocket code you shared earlier is part of this connection process. Here's specifically what you need to do:

1. In Unity:
   - Create a new scene
   - Add an empty GameObject named "WebSocketManager"
   - Attach your WebSocketServer script to it
   - Configure the port and serverUrl parameters in the Inspector

2. In your backend:
   - Set up a WebSocket server that will send visualization data to Unity
   - Make sure it's running on the port you specified in Unity (e.g., localhost:5000)

## Minimal Setup for a Hackathon Demo

For a 2-day hackathon, you might want to focus on a minimal viable demo:

1. **Frontend**: Simple code editor with a few example programs
2. **Backend**: Basic parser that converts specific code patterns to visualization commands
3. **Unity**: Pre-built visualizations for those specific examples that respond to WebSocket messages

This would allow you to demonstrate the concept without building a full production system.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this architecture in more detail? Or would you like example code for any specific component?
